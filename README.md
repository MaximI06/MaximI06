**About Me**
I'm an aspiring, dedicated, and hardworking student with a desire to learn new things and the latest technologies. Passionate about solving interesting and challenging problems, I am not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get things done. I work well in any environment and always look to grow my knowledge and meet new people. With a strong interest in front-end and back-end development, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving, I believe technology is the future and I'm excited to be a part of it.
